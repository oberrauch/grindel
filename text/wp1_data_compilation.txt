2) Glacier outlines
  - GLIMS/RGI:
    - from 5 different dates 1850-2009
    - including area (estimate) in shapefile

    * 1850.09.01: Field and aerial photo reconstruction + Siegfriedmap, transfer to topographic map (1:25000). Manual digitization from transparent paper with topo map in background, using ArcInfo and ArcGIS and later transformation to shape files; Field and aerial photo
    * 1973.09.01: The outlines were directly transferred and digitized from aerial photography to 1:25000 topo maps. In September 1973 favorable conditions for glacier
    * 1998.08.31: TM4/TM5 ratio; Glaciers were automatically mapped from TM raw data using two thresholds: TM3/TM5 > 2.1 and TM1 > 53. The glacier map was smoothed with a 3 by 3 median filter. After raster-vector conversion gross errors were manually removed (water, lakes)
    * 2003.08.06:All glaciers are classified in the main processing stage with a thresholded ratio image and an additional threshold to provide the classification in shadow regions (e.g. Paul and Kaeaeb, 2005); All glaciers are classified in the main processing stage wit
    * 2008.09.30: Glacier outlines were digitized manually in ArcGIS based on SWISSIMAGE Level 2 (swisstopo) imagery. Glacier polygons were coded and named according the outlines of 1973.
    * 2009.09.15: SwissImage L2 aerial orthophotos, manual digitization; Glacier outlines were digitized manually from high-resolution aerial photography (swissimage level 2; 50cm resolution) acquired in september 2008 (34 glaciers); 2009(354 glaciers); 2010 (708 glaciers)

6) Paleoclimate data
  - ...

7) "Non scientific" data
  - nearby webcam stations: http://www.kaikowetter.ch/berneroberlando.html
  - main source: Zumb체hl's Grindelwald book
    - historic paintings and photographs as lenght/extension estimate
    - written sources, like historic documents...
    - CHAP 3: The History of the Upper Grindelwald Glacier since the mid 13th century (p. 115 - 148)
      * Early references from the Middle Ages until the 15th century
        - no usefull source for a sensible topographic reconstruction
        - some written references, used as landmark
      
      * Glacier history in the 16th and 17th century
        - potential short melting period around 1540 (Strasser, 1890; Gruner 1760), glacier retreat behind the "Felsnollen" (LK 649.200/164.425)
        - strong advance around end 16th/begin of 17th century, with maximum glacial extend all the way to the "B채gelbach" (around 1600-1620)
        - first graphical repesentation 1669 by A. Kauw, shows reduce glacier volume and a retreated tongue (700-800m estimated since 1600); side note states that the glacier was advancing again
        - oscillating behavior during the last 14 years of the 17th century

      * Glacier history in the 18th century until 1768
        - possible advance starting around 1703 until 1720ies

      * Advance between 1768 and 1777/78
      	- strong advance starting in 1768, around 50-70 m/yr?!
      	- definitely over the Felsnollen and down to the Gletschersand
      	- maximal extend almost to lowest moraine (1600) near B채rgelbach
      	- extend of advance not fully clear, since initial state of the glacier (1768) unknown; probably around 400-500m in those 10 years

      * Melting phase between 1779 1803
      	- retreat of 150m in 1786 since last maximum (1776/77/78)
      	-
